# abbwak

**API-Based Browser Without API Key** — A free, open-source headless browser tool designed for AI agents.

No API keys. No paid services. Just a powerful, self-hosted browser that agents can control.

---

## Why abbwak?

Existing browser tools for agents (Browserbase, Steel Cloud, Bright Data) charge per session or require API keys. `abbwak` gives you the same capabilities — navigate, interact, extract — running entirely on your own machine with zero cost.

## Status

See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the full implementation plan.
